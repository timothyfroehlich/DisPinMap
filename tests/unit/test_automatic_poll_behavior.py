Test suite for automatic poll behavior verification

This file tests the specific behaviors documented for automatic polls (scheduled monitoring):
- Uses use_min_date=True to fetch only new submissions since last successful check
- Filters submissions to only show those not previously seen
- Updates last_poll_at timestamp only on successful checks
- Suppresses Discord error messages (logs only)
- Respects 24-hour lookback limit from last successful poll

TEST STRUCTURE:
Each test verifies specific behavioral aspects without asserting on message content.
Focus is on API parameter verification, database state changes, and method call patterns.

STARTING CONDITIONS:
- Clean test database with monitoring targets
- Mocked API responses with controlled submission data  
- Mocked Discord bot and channel objects
- Controlled timestamps for time-based testing

ASSERTIONS:
- API calls use correct use_min_date parameter
- Database timestamps are updated correctly on success/failure
- Submission filtering works correctly (new vs seen)
- Error handling follows automatic poll patterns (no Discord messages)
- Notifier methods are called with expected patterns
