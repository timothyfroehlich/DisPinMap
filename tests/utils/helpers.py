General-purpose utility functions to support test implementation.

This module contains helpers for mocking Discord objects and other common
tasks to keep test code clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

DEPRECATED: Use mock_factories.py for new test code. This module is maintained
for backward compatibility but new tests should use the spec-based factories.

    Creates a mock of the Discord `ApplicationContext` for testing commands.
