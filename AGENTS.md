# AI Assistant Guidelines and Task Tracking

## Project Overview
This is a Python Discord bot that continuously monitors the pinballmap.com API for changes in pinball machine locations and posts automated updates to configured Discord channels. The bot supports multiple channels with different notification types and customizable search parameters. It is designed for deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) but can also be run locally.

For a detailed guide on how to use the bot, see [USER_DOCUMENTATION.md](./USER_DOCUMENTATION.md).

## Agent Persona and Guiding Principles

To ensure a productive and positive collaboration, AI assistants working on this project should adopt the following persona and principles:

*   **Be a Proactive Partner, Not Just a Tool:** Don't just execute commands. Actively participate in the problem-solving process. If you hit a roadblock, analyze the situation, form a hypothesis, and propose a next step. The goal is to drive the task forward, not just wait for instructions.
*   **Embrace Transparency and Own Your Mistakes:** If you make an error or a command fails, be upfront about it. Explain what went wrong and what you're doing to correct it. This builds trust and makes debugging more efficient. It's better to say "My last command failed because of a syntax error, I'm correcting it" than to try again silently.
*   **Demonstrate Relentless Persistence:** Complex deployments often fail multiple times. Don't give up after one or two failed attempts. Systematically work through the problem, trying different angles. If one path is blocked (like the stuck SQL instance), pivot to a creative workaround (like creating new `v2` resources).
*   **Value User Guidance:** The user has valuable context. When they offer a suggestion (e.g., "check the logs first," "look in the git history"), treat it as expert advice. Acknowledge the suggestion and immediately incorporate it into your plan. This is a collaborative effort.
*   **Think, Then Act. But Always Act:** It's important to analyze and think, but avoid getting stuck in analysis paralysis. Form a plan and execute it. It's better to try a well-reasoned solution that fails than to do nothing. Every attempt provides more information.
*   **Maintain a Positive and Encouraging Tone:** Frame challenges as obstacles to be overcome together. A "can-do" attitude, even in the face of repeated failures, makes the process much more pleasant and effective.

## Product Decisions

### Notification Filtering
- Initial submissions when adding a new target are filtered according to the channel's notification settings
- Default notification type is 'machines' (additions/removals only)
- Available notification types:
  - `machines`: Only machine additions and removals
  - `comments`: Only condition updates and comments
  - `all`: All submission types

### Submission History
- When adding a new target, the bot displays the 5 most recent submissions
- Submissions are sorted by creation date (newest first)
- The history display respects the channel's notification type settings
- Submissions older than 24 hours are not included in initial display

## Core Technologies
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Discord API**: `discord.py` - Use [Discord.py documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) for all bot development
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM with support for SQLite (local) and PostgreSQL (GCP)
- **API Communication**: `requests` and `aiohttp`
- **Testing**: `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio` and `pytest-xdist`
- **Deployment**: Docker, Terraform, GCP (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Secret Manager)

## Bot Commands
The bot uses slash commands prefixed with `!`.

**Target Monitoring:**
- `!add location <name_or_id>` - Monitor specific locations by ID or name
- `!add city <name> [radius]` - Monitor city areas with optional radius
- `!add coordinates <lat> <lon> [radius]` - Monitor coordinate areas with optional radius
- `!rm <index>` - Remove target by index (use `!list` to see indices)

**General Commands:**
- `!list` or `!ls` - Show all monitored targets with their indices
- `!export` - Export channel configuration as copy-pasteable commands
- `!poll_rate <minutes> [target_index]` - Set polling rate for channel or specific target
- `!notifications <type> [target_index]` - Set notification types (machines, comments, all)
- `!check` - Immediately check for new submissions across all targets

## Development Guidelines
1. **Before Starting Work**
   - Read this file for context
   - Check existing issues
   - Review related documentation
   - **COMMIT ALL CHANGES** before starting major migrations or refactoring

2. **During Development**
   - Follow coding standards
   - Write tests for new features
   - Update documentation
   - Add dependencies to requirements.txt
   - **Make frequent commits** with descriptive messages during major work
   - Create rollback points at key milestones

3. **Before Committing**
   - Run all tests
   - Check type hints
   - Update this file if needed
   - Document significant changes

## Commit Management
- **Always commit before major migrations**: Create a clean rollback point
- **Use descriptive commit messages**: Include context about what phase of work
- **Commit incrementally**: Don't batch large changes into single commits
- **Create milestone commits**: Mark completion of major components
- **Test before committing**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality

## Environment Setup
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL (optional)
- Docker (for containerization)
- GCP tools (for deployment)

## Environment Variables
The bot uses environment variables for configuration, managed through a `.env` file in the project root. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` with the following required variables:

```bash
# Required Variables
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token    # Discord bot token from Discord Developer Portal
DB_TYPE=sqlite                          # Database type: 'sqlite' for local, 'postgresql' for GCP

# Optional Variables (for GCP deployment)
DB_HOST=your_db_host                    # PostgreSQL host (required for DB_TYPE=postgresql)
DB_PORT=5432                            # PostgreSQL port
DB_NAME=your_db_name                    # Database name
DB_USER=your_db_user                    # Database user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password            # Database password
```

The `.env` file is automatically loaded by the bot using python-dotenv. Make sure to:
1. Never commit the `.env` file to version control
2. Keep `.env.example` updated with all required variables
3. Set appropriate values for your environment (local development vs GCP)

## Common Commands
```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Start bot
python3 bot.py
```

## Notes for AI Assistants
1. Always check this file for context before making changes
2. Update task status when completing significant work
3. Follow the coding standards and guidelines
4. Add new dependencies to requirements.txt
5. Document significant changes in this file

## GCP Deployment Configuration

### CRITICAL: Correct Project Information
- **GCP Project ID**: `andy-expl` (NOT `pinballmap-bot`)
- **Region**: `us-central1`
- **Service Name**: `dispinmap-bot-v2`
- **Artifact Registry**: `dispinmap-bot-v2-repo`

This information is defined in:
- `terraform/terraform.tfvars`: Contains the actual project values
- `terraform/variables.tf`: Contains variable definitions

### Deployment Process

#### 1. Pre-deployment Setup
```bash
# Set correct GCP project
gcloud config set project andy-expl

# Authenticate Docker for Artifact Registry
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
```

#### 2. Build and Push Docker Image
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/andy-expl/dispinmap-bot-v2-repo/dispinmap-bot:latest .

# Push to Artifact Registry
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/andy-expl/dispinmap-bot-v2-repo/dispinmap-bot:latest
```

#### 3. Deploy to Cloud Run
```bash
# Deploy new version
gcloud run deploy dispinmap-bot-v2 \
    --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/andy-expl/dispinmap-bot-v2-repo/dispinmap-bot:latest \
    --region us-central1 \
    --platform managed
```

#### 4. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check Cloud Run service status
gcloud run services list --region=us-central1

# Check logs to ensure bot started properly
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=dispinmap-bot-v2" \
    --limit=20 --format="table(timestamp,textPayload)" --project andy-expl
```

#### 5. Common Issues
- **Wrong Project**: Always use `andy-expl`, NOT `pinballmap-bot`
- **Authentication**: Make sure Docker is authenticated with `gcloud auth configure-docker`
- **Repository Names**: The service is `dispinmap-bot-v2`, repository is `dispinmap-bot-v2-repo`

### Accessing Logs for Debugging

#### Quick Log Access Methods

**1. Console-Optimized Format (Best for quick checks)**
```bash
gcloud run services logs read dispinmap-bot-v2 --limit=10 --project andy-expl --region=us-central1
```

**2. Cloud Logging with Formatted Output (Best for detailed debugging)**
```bash
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=dispinmap-bot-v2" \
    --project andy-expl --limit 10 --format="table(timestamp,severity,textPayload)"
```

**3. Real-Time Log Tailing (Best for active debugging)**
```bash
# First-time setup (if needed):
sudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli-log-streaming

# Then tail logs in real-time:
gcloud beta run services logs tail dispinmap-bot-v2 --project andy-expl --region=us-central1
```

**4. Error-Only Logs (Critical for troubleshooting)**
```bash
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=dispinmap-bot-v2 AND severity=ERROR" \
    --project andy-expl --limit 10
```

**5. Search for Specific Error Patterns**
```bash
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=dispinmap-bot-v2 AND textPayload:\"RuntimeError\"" \
    --project andy-expl --limit 5 --format="table(timestamp,severity,textPayload)"
```

**6. Custom Formatted Logs (Compact view)**
```bash
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=dispinmap-bot-v2" \
    --project andy-expl --limit 5 --format="value(timestamp,severity,textPayload)" --freshness=1d
```

#### Console Access (GUI)

**Cloud Run Logs**
- Navigate to: [Cloud Run Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/run?project=andy-expl)
- Click on `dispinmap-bot-v2` service
- Go to **LOGS** tab

**Logs Explorer (Advanced)**
- Navigate to: [Logs Explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query?project=andy-expl)
- Use resource: **Cloud Run Revision**
- Service name: `dispinmap-bot-v2`

#### Debugging Best Practices

1. **Start with Recent Logs**: Use `--limit=10` first to see latest activity
2. **Filter by Severity**: Use `severity=ERROR` for critical issues
3. **Use Pattern Matching**: Search for specific error types with `textPayload:"ErrorType"`
4. **Time-Based Queries**: Add `--freshness=1d` to limit to recent logs
5. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Use `tail` command during active debugging (requires `google-cloud-cli-log-streaming` package)
6. **Structured Queries**: Combine multiple filters for precise debugging

#### Prerequisites for Full Functionality
- **Log Streaming**: Install with `sudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli-log-streaming` for real-time tailing
- **Project Access**: Ensure you're authenticated with `gcloud auth login` and have proper IAM permissions

#### Common Log Sources
- **Request Logs**: HTTP requests to the service (automatic)
- **Container Logs**: Application stdout/stderr (our bot logs)
- **System Logs**: Container startup/health check failures

#### Useful Log Queries
```bash
# Show startup failures
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=dispinmap-bot-v2 AND textPayload:\"STARTUP TCP probe failed\"" --project andy-expl --limit 5

# Show Discord connection issues
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=dispinmap-bot-v2 AND textPayload:\"discord\"" --project andy-expl --limit 10

# Show database connection issues
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=dispinmap-bot-v2 AND textPayload:\"database\"" --project andy-expl --limit 10
```
