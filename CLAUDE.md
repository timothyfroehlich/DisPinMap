# Project Instructions

**This file contains project-specific instructions for AI code agents (Claude, Copilot, etc).**

- If you are using an AI agent to automate coding, testing, or infrastructure tasks, you (and the agent) must read this file first.
- Human contributors: For general developer guidance, see `docs/DEVELOPER_HANDBOOK.md`.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Directory-Specific Agent Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Before working in any directory, consult its specific CLAUDE.md file:

- **üìÅ `src/CLAUDE.md`** - Core application code, models, API clients, command handlers
- **üìÅ `tests/CLAUDE.md`** - Testing framework, mock patterns, test organization
- **üìÅ `terraform/CLAUDE.md`** - Infrastructure as Code, GCP resources, deployment
- **üìÅ `alembic/CLAUDE.md`** - Database migrations, schema changes, SQLAlchemy
- **üìÅ `scripts/CLAUDE.md`** - Utility scripts, validation tools, automation
- **üìÅ `docs/CLAUDE.md`** - Documentation standards, writing guidelines

üí° **Always read the relevant directory CLAUDE.md before making changes in that area.**

## üìö Documentation Map

### For Users & Overview
- `README.md` - Project overview, quick start
- `USER_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Bot command reference

### For Developers
- `docs/DEVELOPER_HANDBOOK.md` - Complete development guide
- `docs/DATABASE.md` - Database schema and patterns
- `tests/README.md` - Testing framework guide

### For AI Agents (This File + Directory-Specific)
- **Main**: `CLAUDE.md` (this file) - Project overview, workflows, standards
- **Specific**: `{directory}/CLAUDE.md` - Directory-specific context and patterns

## CRITICAL: Required Reading

**Before starting any work, you MUST read ALL documentation:**

1. **Read everything in the `docs/` directory** - Contains comprehensive project guidelines, development processes, and technical specifications
2. **Read USER_DOCUMENTATION.md** - User guide for the bot's functionality
3. **Read README.md** - Project overview and setup instructions

## CRITICAL: Branch and Pull Request Workflow

**ALL work must be done in feature branches with PR review:**

1. **Always create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/description` or `fix/description`
2. **Never commit directly to main**
3. **All changes require PR review and approval**
4. **Wait for approval before merging**
5. **Include test results and verification in PR description**
6. **Use descriptive branch names that clearly indicate the purpose**
7. **GitHub branch protection rules require passing status checks before merge**

## Current Status

### Critical Production Issues
**IMPORTANT**: These issues block production use:
- **Issue #66**: `!add` command fails with "target_type missing" (priority-critical)
- **Issue #67**: `!rm` command fails with "index missing" (priority-critical)
- **Issue #68**: `!check` crashes with KeyError 'target_data' (priority-critical)
- **Issue #61**: Location search not creating database entries (priority-critical)

### Test Coverage
- **181 tests PASSING** out of 187 total (96.8% pass rate)
- **6 tests FAILING**: Related to above production issues
- **0 tests SKIPPED**: All tests run successfully

### Infrastructure Status
- **GCP Deployment**: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **Service URL**: https://dispinmap-bot-wos45oz7vq-uc.a.run.app
- **Status**: Bot successfully deployed and running on Google Cloud Run
- **Production Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT YET IN PRODUCTION USE** - Blocked by critical command failures

### Deployment Strategy
- **Deploy on PR Changes**: Deploy all PR changes to Cloud Run service for full end-to-end testing
- **Test in Production Environment**: Use production Cloud Run deployment for comprehensive testing before merge
- **Rationale**: Allows testing full Discord bot functionality in real Cloud Run environment

## Environment Assumptions for Automation

- **Assume GCP, Docker, and Terraform are already installed and authenticated.**
    - All commands can assume the correct GCP project is set, Docker is authenticated for Artifact Registry, and Terraform is initialized and has access to state.
    - No need to repeat authentication or setup steps unless explicitly requested.
- **Assume required environment variables and secrets are already configured.**
    - The bot's Discord token and database credentials are present in Secret Manager and referenced by Terraform.
- **Assume the working directory is the project root unless otherwise specified.**

*Update this section if your environment setup changes or if additional assumptions should be made for automation or agent work.*

For detailed project lessons learned and historical context, load `@project-lessons.md`.

**Note**: AGENT_TASKS.md has been removed - all task tracking now uses GitHub Issues with priority labels.

## Claude Code Commit Attribution

When Claude Code makes commits, use proper attribution to distinguish AI-generated changes:

```bash
git commit --author="Claude Code <claude-code@anthropic.com>" -m "commit message"
```

**Standard commit format:**
- Use descriptive commit messages explaining the changes and reasoning
- Always include the Claude Code signature block:
  ```
  ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

  Co-Authored-By: Claude <claude-code@anthropic.com>
  ```
- Keep user's git configuration unchanged - never modify `git config` settings
- Use `--author` flag instead of changing global git configuration

This ensures clear attribution while preserving the user's personal git settings.

## CRITICAL: Mock Specifications Required

**ALL mocks MUST use proper `spec` parameters to enforce interface compliance:**

### Mock Requirements:
1. **ALWAYS use spec-based factories** from `tests/utils/mock_factories.py`
2. **NEVER use raw `Mock()` or `MagicMock()` without specs**
3. **Use `autospec=True`** for all `@patch` decorators
4. **Validate mock specs** to catch interface violations early

### Factory Functions (REQUIRED):
- `create_async_notifier_mock()` - For Notifier class mocks
- `create_database_mock()` - For Database class mocks
- `create_bot_mock()` - For Discord Bot mocks
- `create_discord_context_mock()` - For Discord Context mocks
- `create_requests_response_mock()` - For HTTP Response mocks

### Examples:
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - No spec validation
mock_notifier = Mock()

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Spec-based factory with interface validation
mock_notifier = create_async_notifier_mock()

# ‚ùå WRONG - Basic patching
@patch("requests.get")

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Autospec patching
@patch("requests.get", autospec=True)
```

**Rationale**: Spec-based mocks catch interface changes at test time, preventing runtime failures and ensuring tests accurately reflect production behavior.

## Other

Never use src.path.append for imports.
