# Project Instructions

**This file contains project-specific instructions for AI code agents (Claude, Copilot, etc).**

- If you are using an AI agent to automate coding, testing, or infrastructure tasks, you (and the agent) must read this file first.
- Human contributors: For general developer guidance, see `docs/DEVELOPER_HANDBOOK.md`.

---

## CRITICAL: Required Reading

**Before starting any work, you MUST read ALL documentation:**

1. **Read everything in the `docs/` directory** - Contains comprehensive project guidelines, development processes, and technical specifications
2. **Read USER_DOCUMENTATION.md** - User guide for the bot's functionality
3. **Read README.md** - Project overview and setup instructions

## CRITICAL: Branch and Pull Request Workflow

**ALL work must be done in feature branches with PR review:**

1. **Always create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/description` or `fix/description`
2. **Never commit directly to main**
3. **All changes require PR review and approval**
4. **Wait for approval before merging**
5. **Include test results and verification in PR description**
6. **Use descriptive branch names that clearly indicate the purpose**
7. **GitHub branch protection rules require passing status checks before merge**

## Current Status

### Test Coverage
- **126 tests PASSING** out of 129 total (97.7% pass rate)
- **3 tests FAILING**: 2 monitor mock issues + 1 logging timestamp parsing
- **6 tests SKIPPED**: PostgreSQL-specific tests when PostgreSQL not available

### Infrastructure Status
- **GCP Deployment**: ‚úÖ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- **Service URL**: https://dispinmap-bot-wos45oz7vq-uc.a.run.app
- **Status**: Bot successfully deployed and running on Google Cloud Run
- **Production Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT YET IN PRODUCTION USE** - Still in development/testing phase

### Deployment Strategy
- **Deploy on PR Changes**: Deploy all PR changes to Cloud Run service for full end-to-end testing
- **Test in Production Environment**: Use production Cloud Run deployment for comprehensive testing before merge
- **Rationale**: Allows testing full Discord bot functionality in real Cloud Run environment

## Environment Assumptions for Automation

- **Assume GCP, Docker, and Terraform are already installed and authenticated.**
    - All commands can assume the correct GCP project is set, Docker is authenticated for Artifact Registry, and Terraform is initialized and has access to state.
    - No need to repeat authentication or setup steps unless explicitly requested.
- **Assume required environment variables and secrets are already configured.**
    - The bot's Discord token and database credentials are present in Secret Manager and referenced by Terraform.
- **Assume the working directory is the project root unless otherwise specified.**

*Update this section if your environment setup changes or if additional assumptions should be made for automation or agent work.*

## Claude Code Commit Attribution

When Claude Code makes commits, use proper attribution to distinguish AI-generated changes:

```bash
git commit --author="Claude Code <claude-code@anthropic.com>" -m "commit message"
```

**Standard commit format:**
- Use descriptive commit messages explaining the changes and reasoning
- Always include the Claude Code signature block:
  ```
  ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

  Co-Authored-By: Claude <claude-code@anthropic.com>
  ```
- Keep user's git configuration unchanged - never modify `git config` settings
- Use `--author` flag instead of changing global git configuration

This ensures clear attribution while preserving the user's personal git settings.

## CRITICAL: Mock Specifications Required

**ALL mocks MUST use proper `spec` parameters to enforce interface compliance:**

### Mock Requirements:
1. **ALWAYS use spec-based factories** from `tests/utils/mock_factories.py`
2. **NEVER use raw `Mock()` or `MagicMock()` without specs**
3. **Use `autospec=True`** for all `@patch` decorators
4. **Validate mock specs** to catch interface violations early

### Factory Functions (REQUIRED):
- `create_async_notifier_mock()` - For Notifier class mocks
- `create_database_mock()` - For Database class mocks
- `create_bot_mock()` - For Discord Bot mocks
- `create_discord_context_mock()` - For Discord Context mocks
- `create_requests_response_mock()` - For HTTP Response mocks

### Examples:
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG - No spec validation
mock_notifier = Mock()

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Spec-based factory with interface validation
mock_notifier = create_async_notifier_mock()

# ‚ùå WRONG - Basic patching
@patch("requests.get")

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Autospec patching
@patch("requests.get", autospec=True)
```

**Rationale**: Spec-based mocks catch interface changes at test time, preventing runtime failures and ensuring tests accurately reflect production behavior.

## Custom Help Command

The bot uses a custom `!help` command defined in `src/cogs/config.py` in the `ConfigCog` class. The default `discord.py` help command is disabled in `src/main.py` during the bot's initialization (`help_command=None`).

The custom command dynamically generates a help message by iterating through all registered commands and displaying the `help` text from their decorators.

**When adding or modifying a command, you MUST update its `help` parameter:**
- The first line of the help text should be a brief summary of the command.
- Subsequent lines can provide more detailed usage, arguments, and examples.
- This ensures that the `!help` command always displays accurate, up-to-date information.

## Commit Workflow Notes

### Pre-Commit Hooks
This project uses pre-commit hooks (`black`, `isort`, `flake8`, `mypy`) to enforce code quality. These hooks run automatically before each commit.

If a commit fails due to a hook:
1.  Read the error message to understand the failure (e.g., formatting issues, linting errors).
2.  Fix the reported issues in your code.
3.  If a hook modified a file (like `black` reformatting code), you **must** `git add` that file again before re-committing.
4.  Attempt the commit again.

### Commit Messages
When writing multi-line commit messages with the `-m` flag, always wrap the entire message in **single quotes (`'`)** instead of double quotes (`"`). This prevents the shell from interpreting special characters like `!` or `` ` ``, which can cause the command to fail.

**Example:**
```bash
git commit -m 'feat: Add new feature

- This is the first bullet point.
- This is the second, explaining the `!thing` command.'
```

## Other

Never use src.path.append for imports.
