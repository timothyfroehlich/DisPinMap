# Remaining Development Tasks

This file contains the remaining tasks from the comprehensive code review that can be completed in future development sessions.

## Medium Priority Tasks

### 10. Create unit tests for command validation and error handling
**Status**: Pending  
**Description**: Create comprehensive tests for command validation scenarios including:
- Invalid coordinate ranges (lat/lon boundaries)
- Invalid radius values (negative, too large)
- Invalid poll rate values (< 15 minutes)
- Invalid notification types
- Malformed command arguments
- Edge cases in confirmation dialogs
- Command execution with missing permissions

**Suggested file**: `test/test_command_validation.py`

## Low Priority Tasks

### 11. Create unit tests for monitor background task functionality
**Status**: Pending  
**Description**: Create tests for background monitoring system including:
- Task startup and shutdown
- Polling interval logic
- Channel polling with different configurations
- Error handling in background tasks
- Task lifecycle management
- Integration with Discord bot events

**Suggested file**: `test/test_monitor_tasks.py`

### 12. Create unit tests for notification filtering by type
**Status**: Pending  
**Description**: Create tests for notification filtering logic including:
- Filtering by 'machines' type (additions/removals only)
- Filtering by 'comments' type (condition updates only)
- Filtering by 'all' type (everything)
- Edge cases with empty submission lists
- Mixed submission types
- Invalid notification type handling

**Suggested file**: `test/test_notification_filtering.py`

## Additional Future Improvements

### Performance Optimization
- Database query optimization for large channel counts
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Background task scheduling improvements

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Retry logic for Discord API failures
- Graceful degradation for external API outages
- Better error messages for user-facing commands

### Monitoring & Observability
- Metrics collection for API response times
- Health check endpoints
- Performance monitoring dashboards

### Security Enhancements
- Rate limiting for user commands
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Audit logging for administrative actions

## Completed Tasks Summary

✅ **All High Priority Issues Fixed**:
1. Fixed coordinate handling bug in check command
2. Added input sanitization for geocoding API calls  
3. Improved notification filtering logic in monitor.py
4. Fixed float precision issues in coordinate comparison

✅ **All Medium Priority Core Tasks Completed**:
5. Removed unused imports and unnecessary comments
6. Added proper logging instead of print statements
7. Added missing type annotations
8. Created unit tests for API rate limiting and error scenarios
9. Created unit tests for database edge cases and session management

**Current Test Coverage**: 74 tests passing
- 36 original tests
- 18 new API edge case tests  
- 20 new database edge case tests

The codebase is now significantly more robust with all critical bugs and security issues addressed.
