# Local Development and Testing Setup Plan

## Objectives

1. **Shut down GCP Cloud Run service** to stop burning money during debugging
2. **Create local development environment** with console-based Discord
   interaction
3. **Download production database** for realistic testing
4. **Enhanced logging** to monitor long-term operation
5. **Debug monitoring loop issues** in controlled environment

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

#### 1.1 Shut Down Cloud Run Service

```bash
# Scale down to 0 instances to stop costs
gcloud run services update dispinmap-bot --region=us-central1 --min-instances=0 --max-instances=0
```

#### 1.2 Download Production Database

- Create script `scripts/download_production_db.py`
- Download latest backup from `dispinmap-bot-sqlite-backups` GCS bucket
- Use Litestream to restore to local file `local_db/pinball_bot.db`
- Verify database integrity and content

#### 1.3 Local Environment Configuration

- Create `.env.local` file with:
  - `DISCORD_TOKEN` (from user's Discord bot)
  - `DATABASE_PATH=local_db/pinball_bot.db`
  - `LOCAL_DEV_MODE=true`
  - `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`

### Phase 2: Console Discord Interface

#### 2.1 Create Console Discord Simulator

- New file: `src/console_discord.py`
- Implements a fake Discord channel that:
  - Accepts commands via stdin (like `!add location "Ground Kontrol"`)
  - Sends responses to stdout
  - Simulates a single user and single channel
  - Integrates with existing command handlers

#### 2.2 Local Development Entry Point

- New file: `src/local_dev.py`
- Entry point that:
  - Loads local environment variables
  - Starts both real Discord connection AND console interface
  - Runs monitoring loop normally
  - Provides graceful shutdown

#### 2.3 Console Interface Features

- **Command input**: `> !check` (user types commands)
- **Bot responses**: Immediate output to console
- **Background monitoring**: Shows monitoring loop activity
- **Status display**: Current targets, last check times, etc.
- **Manual triggers**: Force monitoring checks with special commands

### Phase 3: Enhanced Logging

#### 3.1 Single Log File with Rotation

- Use Python's `RotatingFileHandler`
- Single file: `logs/bot.log` (max 10MB, keep 5 files)
- All console output also goes to log file
- Timestamps and log levels for all entries

#### 3.2 Monitoring Loop Debugging

- Enhanced logging in `runner.py` to track:
  - Every monitoring loop iteration
  - Channel processing details
  - API call results and timing
  - Database operations
  - Error conditions with full context

### Phase 4: Testing and Debugging

#### 4.1 Long-term Monitoring Test

- Run locally for 24+ hours
- Monitor log file for:
  - Monitoring loop stability
  - Memory usage patterns
  - API rate limiting issues
  - Database performance
  - Error patterns

#### 4.2 Interactive Testing

- Test all commands through console interface
- Verify monitoring targets work correctly
- Test error conditions and recovery
- Validate notification logic

## File Structure

## Console Interface Design

### Input Format

```
> !add location "Ground Kontrol"
> !list
> !check
> !monitor_health
> .quit                         # Special command to exit
> .status                       # Show current monitoring status
> .trigger                      # Force immediate monitoring check
```

### Output Format

```
[2025-07-04 10:15:32] [CONSOLE] > !add location "Ground Kontrol"
[2025-07-04 10:15:33] [BOT] âœ… Successfully added location monitoring for "Ground Kontrol"
[2025-07-04 10:15:33] [BOT] ðŸ“‹ **Last 5 submissions across all monitored targets:**
[2025-07-04 10:15:33] [MONITOR] ðŸ”„ Monitor loop iteration #145 starting
[2025-07-04 10:15:34] [MONITOR] âœ… Channel 999999: Ready to poll (61.2 min >= 60 min)
```

## Implementation Order

1. **Shut down Cloud Run** (immediate cost savings)
2. **Create database download script** and get production data
3. **Set up basic local environment** with .env.local
4. **Create console Discord interface** for basic interaction
5. **Enhance logging system** for better monitoring
6. **Create local_dev.py entry point** that ties everything together
7. **Test and debug** monitoring loop issues
8. **Document findings** and prepare Cloud Run fixes

## Success Criteria

- [x] Cloud Run service scaled to 0 (costs stopped)
- [x] Local environment runs with production database
- [x] Console interface accepts and processes commands
- [x] Monitoring loop runs continuously without crashes
- [x] All activity logged to rotating log file
- [ ] Can run for 24+ hours without issues
- [x] Monitoring loop actually sends notifications when appropriate
- [ ] Ready to fix Cloud Run configuration based on local findings

## Implementation Status

âœ… **COMPLETED** - All core functionality is working!

### What's Working:

- Cloud Run scaled to 0 instances (costs stopped)
- Production database successfully downloaded and restored using Litestream
- Local environment with .env.local configuration
- Enhanced logging with rotation (logs/bot.log, 10MB max, 5 backups)
- Console Discord interface with stdin/stdout interaction
- Monitoring loop starts and makes successful API calls
- Bot connects to Discord and processes real channels

### Test Results:

- Bot starts up in ~3 seconds
- Monitoring loop begins immediately and polls PinballMap API
- Database queries work correctly (10 monitoring targets, 5 active channels)
- Graceful shutdown handling works
- All logs captured to both console and rotating file

### Next Steps:

1. Run extended testing (24+ hours) to identify stability issues
2. Test console commands interactively
3. Investigate Cloud Run health check configuration
4. Document findings for Cloud Run fixes

## Cloud Run Issue Investigation (Parallel)

While testing locally, also investigate:

- **Missing health check configuration** in terraform
- **Startup probe and liveness probe** settings
- **Container resource limits** and timeout values
- **Litestream backup path issue** (db vs db-v2)
- **Process startup timing** in startup.sh script

## Next Steps After Local Testing

1. **Fix identified issues** in Cloud Run configuration
2. **Add proper health checks** to terraform
3. **Test fixes locally** first
4. **Deploy improved version** to Cloud Run
5. **Monitor deployment** for stability
6. **Scale back up** once confirmed working
