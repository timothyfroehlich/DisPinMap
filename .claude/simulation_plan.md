# Simulation Testing Framework Implementation Plan

## Status: IN PROGRESS
**Branch**: `feature/simulation-testing-framework`
**Started**: 2025-06-20

## Objectives
Create a comprehensive end-to-end simulation testing framework that validates the entire Discord bot pipeline - from command handling through API interactions to periodic monitoring notifications.

## Progress Tracking

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
- [x] Create feature branch: `feature/simulation-testing-framework`
- [x] Set up .claude tracking directory
- [ ] Extend test database utilities
- [ ] Document branch purpose in CLAUDE.md updates

### üîÑ Phase 2: API Response Capture & Simulation
- [ ] Create API response capture scripts
- [ ] Store responses in structured format
- [ ] Build configurable API mock system
- [ ] Implement timing simulation
- [ ] Validate mock responses match real API schema

### ‚è≥ Phase 3: Discord Simulation Framework
- [ ] Create comprehensive Discord mock system
- [ ] Implement message capture system
- [ ] Build isolated bot test runner
- [ ] Create command execution framework
- [ ] Integrate with existing test framework

### ‚è≥ Phase 4: Periodic Monitoring Simulation
- [ ] Mock datetime.now() for controllable time
- [ ] Create time-travel utilities
- [ ] Implement rapid polling simulation
- [ ] Test background monitoring loop
- [ ] End-to-end monitoring flows

### ‚è≥ Phase 5: User Journey Testing
- [ ] Location monitoring journey scripts
- [ ] City monitoring journey
- [ ] Coordinates monitoring journey
- [ ] Configuration testing
- [ ] Error scenario testing

### ‚è≥ Phase 6: Response Analysis & Validation
- [ ] Message content validation
- [ ] Behavioral verification
- [ ] Performance & reliability testing

### ‚è≥ Phase 7: Test Suite Integration
- [ ] Pytest integration
- [ ] Documentation & usage
- [ ] Continuous testing support

## Key Files Created

### Tracking & Documentation
- `.claude/simulation_plan.md` - This progress tracking file

### API Response Capture
- (TBD) `tests/fixtures/api_responses/` - Captured real API responses
- (TBD) `scripts/capture_api_responses.py` - Response capture script

### Simulation Framework
- (TBD) `tests/simulation/` - Simulation test modules
- (TBD) `tests/utils/simulation.py` - Simulation utilities
- (TBD) `tests/utils/discord_mock.py` - Discord mocking framework

### Test Modules
- (TBD) `tests/simulation/test_user_journeys.py` - Complete user flow tests
- (TBD) `tests/simulation/test_periodic_monitoring.py` - Background task tests
- (TBD) `tests/simulation/test_api_integration.py` - API integration tests

## Current Focus
Setting up the foundation and beginning API response capture phase.

## Notes & Discoveries
- Existing test infrastructure in `tests/utils/` provides good foundation
- Current mock system in unit tests can be extended
- Need to be careful with timing manipulation to avoid affecting other tests
- May discover bugs in periodic monitoring during implementation

## Next Steps
1. Create API response capture scripts
2. Set up structured response storage
3. Begin building mock API framework
4. Start Discord simulation infrastructure
