# Agent Tasks

## Completed Tasks

### GCP Deployment
- ✅ Updated requirements.txt with GCP dependencies (google-cloud-secret-manager, google-cloud-sql-connector[pg8000], aiohttp).
- ✅ Modified src/database.py for dual database support (SQLite and PostgreSQL).
- ✅ Added secrets management and health check endpoint to src/main.py.
- ✅ Created a multi-stage Dockerfile with a non-root user and virtual environment.
- ✅ Set up Terraform infrastructure for GCP deployment (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, Artifact Registry).
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to ignore Terraform state files and sensitive files.
- ✅ Updated README.md with local and GCP deployment instructions.
- ✅ Verified local functionality with SQLite and .env file.

### High Priority Fixes
- ✅ Fixed coordinate handling bug in check command.
- ✅ Added input sanitization for geocoding API calls.
- ✅ Improved notification filtering logic in monitor.py.
- ✅ Fixed float precision issues in coordinate comparison.

### Medium Priority Core Tasks
- ✅ Removed unused imports and unnecessary comments.
- ✅ Added proper logging instead of print statements.
- ✅ Added missing type annotations.
- ✅ Created unit tests for API rate limiting and error scenarios.
- ✅ Created unit tests for database edge cases and session management.

## Pending Tasks

### Unit Tests
- **Task 10**: Create unit tests for command validation and error handling (e.g., invalid coordinates, poll rates, notification types).
- **Task 11**: Create unit tests for monitor background task functionality (e.g., task lifecycle, polling logic).
- **Task 12**: Create unit tests for notification filtering by type (e.g., machines, comments, all).

### Future Improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Database query optimization, caching, background task scheduling.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Retry logic for Discord API failures, graceful degradation for external API outages.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics collection, health check endpoints, performance dashboards.
- **Security Enhancements**: Rate limiting, input validation, audit logging.

## Current Test Coverage
- 74 tests passing (36 original, 18 API edge case, 20 database edge case).
