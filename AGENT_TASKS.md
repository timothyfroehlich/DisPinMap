# Agent Tasks

This file tracks major completed tasks and ongoing activities for the DisPinMap project.

## Current Activity
**Active Task**: Periodic Check Fix and Deployment (2025-06-28)
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Successfully identified and fixed periodic check issue
- **Date**: 2025-06-28

### Latest Deployment Details (2025-06-28)
**Issue**: Periodic check was not running in production
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Missing `alembic` dependency** - Not included in `pyproject.toml`
- **Incorrect alembic database URL** - `alembic.ini` pointed to test database instead of production
- **Missing task loop start** - `monitor_task_loop.start()` not called in `cog_load` method

**Solution Applied**:
1. Added `alembic` to dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
2. Fixed `alembic/env.py` to use `DATABASE_PATH` environment variable
3. Added `self.monitor_task_loop.start()` call in `cog_load` method

**Deployment Status**:
- Service URL: https://dispinmap-bot-825480538445.us-central1.run.app
- Active Revision: `dispinmap-bot-00007-jlk` (created 2025-06-28T04:00:51Z)
- Health Check: ✅ Passing
- Bot Status: ✅ Connected and operational

**Verification**:
- ✅ Container build successful with all dependencies
- ✅ Database migrations running correctly
- ✅ Monitor cog loading successfully
- ✅ Task loop starting when bot is ready
- ✅ Existing monitoring targets confirmed (Austin, Denver, Portland, Chicago)

## Previous Activity
**Monitor Loop Improvements Deployment (PR #45)**
- **Status**: ✅ **DEPLOYED** - Successfully deployed to GCP Cloud Run
- **Date**: 2025-06-26

### PR #45 CI Linting Issues Resolution (2025-06-26)
**Issue**: CI pipeline failing due to black formatting violations
**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Found exact issue from summary**: Version mismatch between multiple CI linting sources
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml`: Uses latest black from pip (25.1.0+)
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Uses pinned black rev: 23.12.1
- Local environment: Uses black 25.1.0
- **Two different CI workflows** both checking formatting with different versions

**Solution Applied (Temporary)**:
- Applied black formatting to satisfy current CI requirements
- Updated files: `tests/unit/test_manual_check_behavior.py`, `src/cogs/monitor.py`
- All checks now pass: black, flake8, mypy, 104 unit tests

**Long-term Solution Needed**:
- Choose single source of truth for tool versions
- Option 1: Update `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to use same black version as CI
- Option 2: Have CI use `pre-commit run --all-files` instead of direct tool calls
- Option 3: Pin black version in `requirements.txt` for consistency

**Lessons Applied**:
- Single incremental fix (formatting only)
- Avoided scope creep by not attempting other fixes simultaneously
- Verified all checks pass before completion
- **Confirmed exact issue described in user summary**: "version mismatch between local pre-commit and CI"

### PR #45 Background Context - Monitor Loop Improvements (Issue #41)
**Major Achievement**: Successfully implemented comprehensive monitor loop improvements including:
- Fixed critical database query bug in `get_active_channels()`
- Added comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- Enhanced logging system with detailed metrics and emojis
- Implemented health monitoring with `!monitor_health` command
- Improved task loop resilience for individual channel failures

**Previous Debugging Session Summary** (Referenced in user feedback):
- **Challenge**: Conflicting CI/local linting tool versions causing inconsistent checks
- **Lesson Learned**: Need single source of truth for tool configurations
- **Lesson Learned**: Make small, incremental changes rather than fixing multiple issues simultaneously
- **Lesson Learned**: Version mismatches between local pre-commit and CI can cause "works on my machine" problems
- **Resolution Strategy**: Reverted complex changes, then applied targeted fix for current formatting issues

## Next Priorities
1. **High Priority**: Establish single source of truth for linting tool versions to prevent recurrence
2. Monitor PR #45 merge status after CI passes
3. Address any remaining monitor loop testing or deployment issues
4. Continue with normal development workflow

## Identified Technical Debt
**CI Configuration Inconsistency**:
- `.github/workflows/lint.yml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml` use different black versions
- Should be unified to prevent future version conflicts
- This mirrors the exact scenario from the debugging session summary
