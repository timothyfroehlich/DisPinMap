## Completed Tasks

### PR #45 CI Linting Issues Resolution (2025-06-26)
**Issue**: CI pipeline failing due to black formatting violations
**Root Cause**: Minor line length formatting issues in 2 files
**Solution Applied**:
- Applied black formatting to fix line length violations in:
  - `tests/unit/test_manual_check_behavior.py`
  - `src/cogs/monitor.py`
**Verification**:
- ✅ Black formatting: All files pass
- ✅ Flake8 linting: No issues
- ✅ MyPy type checking: No issues
- ✅ Unit tests: All 104 tests passing
**Lessons Applied**:
- Single incremental fix (formatting only)
- Avoided scope creep by not attempting other fixes simultaneously
- Verified all checks pass before completion

### PR #45 Background Context - Monitor Loop Improvements (Issue #41)
**Major Achievement**: Successfully implemented comprehensive monitor loop improvements including:
- Fixed critical database query bug in `get_active_channels()`
- Added comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- Enhanced logging system with detailed metrics and emojis
- Implemented health monitoring with `!monitor_health` command
- Improved task loop resilience for individual channel failures

**Previous Debugging Session Summary** (Referenced in user feedback):
- **Challenge**: Conflicting CI/local linting tool versions causing inconsistent checks
- **Lesson Learned**: Need single source of truth for tool configurations
- **Lesson Learned**: Make small, incremental changes rather than fixing multiple issues simultaneously
- **Lesson Learned**: Version mismatches between local pre-commit and CI can cause "works on my machine" problems
- **Resolution Strategy**: Reverted complex changes, then applied targeted fix for current formatting issues

## Next Priorities
1. Monitor PR #45 merge status after CI passes
2. Address any remaining monitor loop testing or deployment issues
3. Continue with normal development workflow
