# Agent Tasks

## Completed Tasks

### CRITICAL BUG FIXES (URGENT)
- ✅ **Fixed Monitor Partial Changes Bug**: Restored missing `is_manual_check` parameter to `run_checks_for_channel()` method
  - **Issue**: `!check` command was passing `is_manual_check=True` but `monitor.py` didn't accept this parameter
  - **Impact**: Manual checks were failing silently, automatic monitoring was using wrong API parameters
  - **Root Cause**: Partially applied changes left the codebase in inconsistent state
- ✅ **Fixed API Call Parameters**:
  - **Automatic monitoring**: Now uses `use_min_date=True` (only recent submissions from yesterday+)
  - **Manual checks**: Now uses `use_min_date=False` (all submissions, limited to last 5 displayed)
  - **Impact**: This fixes why automatic monitoring missed new games and why !check showed all submissions
- ✅ **Added Manual Check User Feedback**: Manual checks now provide clear feedback when no submissions found
- ✅ **Fixed Manual Check Display Logic**: Manual checks now limit display to last 5 submissions with proper sorting

### GCP Deployment
- ✅ Updated requirements.txt with GCP dependencies (google-cloud-secret-manager, google-cloud-sql-connector[pg8000], aiohttp).
- ✅ Modified src/database.py for dual database support (SQLite and PostgreSQL).
- ✅ Added secrets management and health check endpoint to src/main.py.
- ✅ Created a multi-stage Dockerfile with a non-root user and virtual environment.
- ✅ Set up Terraform infrastructure for GCP deployment (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Secret Manager, Artifact Registry).
- ✅ Updated .gitignore to ignore Terraform state files and sensitive files.
- ✅ Updated README.md with local and GCP deployment instructions.
- ✅ Verified local functionality with SQLite and .env file.

### Docker
- ✅ Built Docker image successfully.
- ✅ Pushed Docker image to Google Artifact Registry.

### High Priority Fixes
- ✅ Fixed coordinate handling bug in check command.
- ✅ Added input sanitization for geocoding API calls.
- ✅ Improved notification filtering logic in monitor.py.
- ✅ Fixed float precision issues in coordinate comparison.

### Medium Priority Core Tasks
- ✅ Removed unused imports and unnecessary comments.
- ✅ Added proper logging instead of print statements.
- ✅ Added missing type annotations.
- ✅ Created unit tests for API rate limiting and error scenarios.
- ✅ Created unit tests for database edge cases and session management.

### Command Reorganization & UX Improvements
- ✅ Unified add/remove commands:
    - Implemented single `!add` command with subcommands/types (e.g., `!add location ...`, `!add city ...`, `!add coordinates ...`).
    - Implemented single `!rm <index>` command to remove the Nth monitored item as shown in `!list`.
    - `!add location` supports both name and ID; `!add city` by name only.
- ✅ Enhanced listing & removal UX:
    - `!list` shows all monitored targets for the channel, with index numbers for easy reference.
    - `!rm <index>` removes the item at the given index from `!list`.
- ✅ Added export functionality:
    - Implemented `!export` command that outputs a copy-pasteable list of `!add`/`!set` commands.
- ✅ Enhanced poll rate & notifications:
    - `!poll_rate <minutes>` sets the default poll rate for the channel.
    - `!poll_rate <minutes> <index>` sets the poll rate for a specific target.
    - `!notifications <type>` sets the default notification type for the channel.
    - `!notifications <type> <index>` sets the notification type for a specific target.
    - Added `notification_types` field to MonitoringTarget model for per-target support.
    - When a default is set, all current targets and channel config are updated; new targets inherit the default.
- ✅ Improved help & discoverability:
    - Updated help output to be clear, grouped, and include examples.
    - Added command aliases for quick reference.
- ✅ Added comprehensive test suite:
    - Created tests/test_commands_reorg.py with 20+ test cases.
    - Tests cover all new command functionality (add, remove, list, export).
    - Tests verify poll rate and notification type settings.
    - Tests include error cases and edge conditions.
    - Added pytest-xdist for parallel test execution.

## Pending Tasks

### Remaining Test Fixes
- **Task 8**: Fix monitor test mocks (2 failing tests) - Mock channel setup issues in `test_poll_channel_with_targets` and `test_send_notifications_multiple_machines`
- **Task 9**: Fix logging timestamp parsing (1 failing test) - ANSI color code handling in `test_colored_formatter`

### Recently Completed
- ✅ **Added Functional Tests for !check Command**: Created comprehensive test suite for the `!check` command in `tests/func/test_commands.py`
  - **Coverage**: 5 test cases covering normal operation, error conditions, and integration scenarios
  - **Tests**: Valid targets, missing monitor cog, no targets, exception handling, and integration with real monitor
  - **Purpose**: Help diagnose issues when `!check` command fails, ensure proper interaction between monitoring cog and monitor cog
  - **Result**: All tests passing, provides debugging capabilities for future `!check` command issues

### Future Improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Database query optimization, caching, background task scheduling.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Retry logic for Discord API failures, graceful degradation for external API outages.
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics collection, health check endpoints, performance dashboards.
- **Security Enhancements**: Rate limiting, input validation, audit logging.

## Current Test Coverage
- **126 tests PASSING** out of 129 total (97.7% pass rate)
- **3 tests FAILING**: 2 monitor mock issues + 1 logging timestamp parsing
- **6 tests SKIPPED**: PostgreSQL-specific tests when PostgreSQL not available

- No regression in test execution or coverage.

## [2024-06-09] Add --test-startup flag to main.py

- Added a command-line flag `--test-startup` to main.py.
- When run with this flag, the bot will start, connect to Discord, then immediately shut down and exit.
- Useful for CI and environment verification.

## GCP Deployment

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

The bot is now successfully deployed and running on Google Cloud Run. We overcame several challenges, including a stuck Cloud SQL instance and a fundamental issue with running a non-HTTP service on Cloud Run.

**The final, working solution involved:**
1.  Creating a new set of infrastructure (`dispinmap-bot-v2`) to bypass the stuck resources.
2.  Implementing a lightweight `aiohttp` web server within the bot to respond to Cloud Run's health checks.

**Service URL:** `https://dispinmap-bot-v2-wos45oz7vq-uc.a.run.app`

This URL is for the health check endpoint and is not meant for user interaction. The bot itself is now running and should be active in your Discord server.

**⚠️ Important Cleanup Note:**

The original Cloud SQL instance (`dispinmap-bot-db-instance`) is still stuck in your GCP project. You will need to manually delete this from the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances) at your convenience. Since Terraform is no longer managing it, it won't be affected by future `terraform apply` or `destroy` commands for the `v2` service.

Thank you for your patience and for guiding me toward the correct solutions. It was a pleasure working with you to get this deployed!
